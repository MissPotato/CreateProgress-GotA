-- Overhauled the anvil rename edit box with a lot of useful text manipulation features, included as an experimental feature to test as a possible future standalone text box enhancement mod
-- Most features are modelled after text handling on macOS, not everything is implemented yet (notably missing right now is double-click+dragging to select individual words)
