Progress Create: GotA Editions v0.4.1
#GotA Additions#
Short version of changes:
- Blocks added by Ecologics will not show up in already existing chunks. Probably can get them with bonemeal.
- Wildlife expanded mainly because someone wanted seals, and I personally loved Ecoligic's snails.
Chunk Sending should help the noticable lag spikes when people use waystones, go to the nether, etc. 


- Added Mods
-- Creatures from the Snow: Expands animal variety in snow biomes. (Namely adds seals) 
-- Chunks Sending: Optimizes chunk loading for batch chunk loads. (IE: TPing and logging in)
-- Naturalist: Expands animal variety in Grassy and Dry biomes.
-- Ecologics: Expands animal and shrubbery variety in costal, deserts, snowy plains, lush caves

#Beging GotA Additions#

- Added Mods:
-- Clay Soldiers: A port of the really old clay soldiers mod. 
-- Connectivity: Allows configuring network level stuff, most importantly the time the client or server will time out the other for taking too long to connect. Useful for if a player has really bad connection to the server. (This is a bandaid fix, their connection will still be poor.)
-- Crawl: adds a keybind to do vanilla's crawling on demand. Super useful for pipe networks.
-- Immersive Paintings: Lets users create ingame vanilla-like paintings using web URLs. (I don't suggest adding this upstream, as the server actually downloads these images. Though the config is quite flexible.)
-- Jade: Yet another port of WAYLA. This one has block harvestability. 
-- Jade Addons: Lets Jade support more mods.
-- Log Protection: Allows you to extend the time a player is shielded from any damage upon changing dimensions and logging in. Further expands the feature to make it so any player movement cancels the protection. Same idea as Connectivity.
-- Lootr: Per player instanced loot chests. It can't replace containers that have already been opened, but handles unopened containers fine. Pruning chunks of course will work as well.
-- Nature's Compass: A compass for finding biomes. 
-- Now Playing: Adds a toast notification for minecraft's non-jukebox music. Jukeboxs already do something like this. 
-- Portable Crafting: Crafting tables on a stick. 


- Removed Mods:
-- WTHIT: Replaced with Jade, adds more functionality, namely block harvestability
-- Megane: Addon for WTHIT 
-- Controlling: Only slightly better search than AMECS while breaking AMECS.
-- BCLib, Better Nether, Better End: few players really didn't like it.  


- Pack Update: 
-- Merge PR for 0.3.1 with the pack. Changes below.
-- See ChangelogFull for changes
